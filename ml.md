## Machine Learning Projects
### **1. Simple Text Summarizer**: An NLP app summarizing English text with the Hugging Face T5 model. [GitHub](https://github.com/Khandoker09/simple_text_summarizer)

It is an open-source library. From this library, we have used the T5-small model. The T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer) model is primarily an abstractive model. Abstractive models generate summaries or paraphrases in a more human-like manner by understanding the input text and generating new, coherent text that captures the essential meaning of the input. They have the ability to produce summaries that may not appear verbatim in the input text and can provide more concise and coherent summaries compared to extractive methods.
#### Tips: Try to avoid the author name, image, or table, only paste the the text you want to summarize

  
### **2. Emotion Detection**: A Deep Learning app using CNN to detect emotions from images. [GitHub](https://github.com/Khandoker09/image_deep_L)

This is a very simple app to detect human emotion from the image. A simple deep learning convolutional network was trained over 10100 images of people with sad and happy faces. This model was used in the background of this app. This model can only predict two emtion of human either happy or sad, so its a binary classifier.

### **3. Parking Space Tracker**: A project to track and count parking spaces from video feeds, built with Python and OpenCV. [GitHub](https://github.com/Khandoker09/Parkspacemonitor)

##### Project Overview
This project utilizes Computer Vision techniques, leveraging the OpenCV library, to develop a real-time parking space monitoring system. The system analyzes video streams from cameras installed over parking lots to detect empty mathematically and occupied spaces, helping drivers quickly find available spots and optimize parking lot usage.

### Features
- **Real-Time Detection**: Monitors parking spaces in real-time.
- **Space Availability**: Identifies and marks available parking spaces.
- **Efficient Parking**: Reduces time spent searching for parking spots.
- **Video Stream Processing**: Processes live video feeds from cameras.
